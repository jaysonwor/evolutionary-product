## Background
I've begun to think that technical skills must be honed every so often, otherwise, you will lose them over time. I find this especially true as I get older. Furthermore, although technology is constantly evolving I have been able to identify commonalities over my tenure that stand the test of time. Therefore, I am going to create a product. I am not quite sure what this product is yet but I anticipate that it will be used to help derive other products in the future. Finally, I welcome any other contributors on this product as learning from others is truly the best way to hone your skills.

## Contributors
I welcome anyone who wishes to contribute on this as long as some simple guiding principles are followed (to ensure whatever is built is also cohesive)

## Guiding Principles
* Any language can be used but within context - this means no mixing languages within a sub-module (e.g client/front-end) 
* Strive for clean and working code - write code that is legible by others, and don't submit knowingly broken code, if it's in-progress put in another branch, comment, or some other temporary placeholders
* maintain a consistent architecture - there is a evolving architectural reference that should over time provide the structure to ensure this product maintains cohesion


## Architectural Reference
This is a living document that will evolve over the course of product evolutions
### Folder Structure 
* frontend 
### GIT Branch strategy
* main - initial branch development
